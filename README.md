# DingPics

World of Warcraft add-on to automatically screenshot when you level up.

By default the screenshot is triggered 1 second after the PLAYER_LEVEL_UP event for optimal view of the yellow animation. You can adjust this in DingPics.lua if you want.

## Install

Download the folder and extract in `BattleNet\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`. Make sure the folder is called `DingPics` and not `DingPics-master`.

We also suggest that you use WoWUp.io to manage your addons. To add this addon to WoWUp, go to the "Get Addons" tab, click the "Install from URL" button in the top right corner, and enter the URL of this repo (```https://github.com/fouronnes/DingPics```).
